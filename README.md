# ML Project
## Objective
Develop and deploy a state-of-the-art classification model using advanced machine learning techniques.

## Dataset Description
The dataset provided is designed for a data classification problem. All columns are anonymized and categorized, with column names indicating feature indices and data types.

## Summary Report
The summary report should include a detailed explanation of how you addressed the following aspects in your implementation:

### Data Preprocessing:
Techniques used to clean, transform, and prepare the data for training.
### Feature Engineering:
Methods for selecting and transforming relevant features, including:
Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Feature scaling and normalization
Generating new features through feature interaction or domain knowledge
Model Training and Development:
Process of training the model, covering:
Model selection and justification
Handling imbalanced data (e.g., oversampling, undersampling, synthetic data generation)
Model evaluation using appropriate metrics (precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)
Hyperparameter tuning methods and their outcomes
Experiment Tracking:
Tools and practices used to track training runs and outcomes, highlighting:
Setup of experiment tracking
How tracking aided in comparing different model versions
Any visualizations or dashboards used to monitor experiments
